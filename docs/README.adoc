Excel VBA class that bundles stuff to "speed up" VBA code execution.

This is essentially a republish of Brian Satola's class which can be found at {uri-CheJunkie-SpeedUpExcel}.
So all credits go to him!

The main reason for this repository is to increase its visibility.

== Features

Bundle some common tricks to speed up VBA code execution.
These mainly are

* turn off worksheet calculation
* turn off screen updating
* ignore events

== Prerequisites / Dependencies

Since this is an Excel VBA class you obviously need Microsoft Excel.

[#how-to-install]
== How to install / Getting started

Add the file(s) from the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder to your project.
Yes, it's that simple.

._If you need some more advice on how to do that, expand me._
[%collapsible]
====
. Open Microsoft Excel.
. Open the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) (kbd:[Alt+F11]).
. Add the file(s) in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder to your VBA project.
** With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
.. Right-click on the project to which you want to add the file(s) in the "`Code Explorer`" (to show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R]) and click on menu:Add[Existing Files...].
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder and click on btn:[Open].
** Without Rubberduck:
.. Select all files in the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder in Windows File Explorer.
.. Drag-and-drop them to the corresponding project in VBE's "`Project Explorer`". +
   (To show it press kbd:[Ctrl+R].
   Hit it twice if the Code Explorer shows up first.)
// BUG: "project name" can't be put in normal angle brackets, because the closing bracket would be interpreted as menu delimiter. I couldn't find a way how to "escape" that (i.e. a backslash didn't work). Thus, single guillemets are used.
. Check, if there are obvious errors by compiling the project (menu:Debug[Compile â€¹project nameâ€º]).
. Save the file/project.
.. Be sure that the file/project you want to save is "`active`" in the VBE by checking, if its name is shown in VBE's title bar. +
   (If it's not, open a (class) module of the corresponding project (and close it again).)
.. Press the "`Save`" button (the disc symbol similar to ðŸ’¾) in VBE's toolbar.
.. Check that the file (really) was saved by having a look at the "`last modified date`" of the (project) file in the Windows File Explorer.
====

== Usage / Show it in action

A most basic example is

[source,vba]
----
Public Sub DoSomething()
    Dim SpeedUp As XLSpeedUp
    Set SpeedUp = New XLSpeedUp
    SpeedUp.TurnOn

    'do something

    SpeedUp.TurnOff
End Sub
----

You can also have a look in the link:{demodir}[demo] folder for a full (dummy) example.

== Running Tests

Yes, {uri-UnitTests}[Unit Tests] in Excel _are_ possible.
For that you need to have the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] AddIn installed (and enabled).

The procedure is very similar to the one given in the <<how-to-install>> section, but this time add the files from the link:{testdir}[tests] folder (instead of the files from the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder).
When you are done with that, additionally perform the following steps.

. Check that the files from the link:{sourcedir}[src] folder are present in the project as well or that you have a reference to project with the source files.footnote:[
   See the collapsible in the next point on how to do that.
   If you use the Rubberduck way, before adding the reference you first need to switch to the menu:Projects[] tab.
] +
  (Otherwise tests will/should fail.)
. Add a reference to the "`Rubberduck AddIn`" to the project (with the test modules).
+
._If you don't have a clue how to do that, expand me._
[%collapsible]
====
* With {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck]:
. Right-click somewhere on the project in the "`Code Explorer`" and click on menu:Add/Remove{sp}References...[].
. Add the reference.
.. Type (parts of) the library name in the search box until you see it in below (left) list or it is empty.
** If the AddIn file name is in the lower left list box:
... Select the library in the (left) list and
... click on the btn:[âž¨] button to add it to the project references. +
** If the the AddIn file name is _not_ in the list:
... Click on the btn:[Browse...] button.
... Browse to the folder where the AddIn is located.
... Select the AddIn and
... press the btn:[Open] button.
. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the window.
* Without Rubberduck:
. Open the Reference manager in the VBE (menu:Tools[References...]).
** If the AddIn project name is in the list of available references:
.. Add a checkmark to the corresponding library.
** If it's _not_ in the list:
.. Click on the btn:[Browse...] button.
.. Browse to the folder where the AddIn is located.
.. Select the AddIn and
.. press the btn:[Open] button.
. Click on the btn:[OK] button to close the window.
. Save the file/project.
====
+
. Open the "`Test Explorer`" (menu:Rubberduck[Unit Tests > Test Explorer]).
. Run the tests by clicking menu:Run[All Tests].

This project is used by (at least) these projects:

* https://github.com/VBA-tools2/SeriesEntriesInCharts.vba[]

If you know more, we will be happy to add them here.
In addition it is used by a lot of private, i.e. non-public, Excel AddIns created by the authors.

== Known issues and limitations

All contributions are highly welcome!!

If you are new to git/GitHub, please have a look at {uri-GitHub-FirstContribution} where you will find a lot of useful information for beginners.

We recently were pointed to {uri-commit-messages} which sounds very promising.
We will use them from now on too (and hopefully don't forget it in a hurry).
